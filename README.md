# gtsTracker
The GTS Tracker is a portfolio project designed with the sole purpose of tracking a specific Porsche 911 GTS that belonged to a friend's father. Queries can be handled by simply pressing the button, or automatically via scheduled requests that are logged to the UI. Once the GTS has been located, an alert is sent via email.
